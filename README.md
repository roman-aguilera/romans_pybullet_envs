# romans_pybullet_envs

This is where I keep my custom gym environments. To use them, enter the following commands from the terminal:

```
cd <path/to/where/you/want/to/store/these/files>
git clone https://github.com/roman-aguilera/romans_pybullet_envs.git
cd romans_pybullet_envs
pip install -e .
```



The environments that I added myself are found below

the 8-link octopus environment:

the 8-link octopus environment (with joint locking):
